# Cyber-Rush 🛹

### 💡 Inspiration
The concept was born from an  [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPGoGESERLx/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) where **Google India collaborated with a YT Gamer(XyaaLive)**, turning her image into a **16-bit-style game character** using **Gemini Nano Banana**. In her post, she asked someone to make the generated image into a real game. That sparked the idea for **Cyber Rush**, where the same approach was used to create an game inspired by the iconic [Google Chrome Dino Game](https://chromedino.com/). Built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## Character Created using Gemini

Following are done in the game using Gemini:
- 🧍‍♀️ The Character is a skateboarding hero, a digital likeness of the gamer generated by **Gemini Nano Banana**.
- 🎞️ Character's riding and jumping animations were created using **Gemini Veo**, and background elements were removed for clean, transparent sprites.
- 🌆 Game assets such as the background and obstacles were also generated using the same AI tools.

This project blends creativity and code, using AI-assisted visual generation and good old-fashioned JavaScript to bring everything to life — no external libraries or engines involved.
