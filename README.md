### 💡 Inspiration

The concept was born from an **Instagram post** where **Google collaborated with a YT Gamer(XyaaLive)**, turning her into a **16-bit-style game character** using **Gemini Nano Banana**.She asked in the post that someone make the image into a real game. That sparked the idea for **Cyber Rush**, where the same approach was used to create an game inspired by the iconic [Google Chrome Dino Game](https://chromedino.com/). Built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

Following are done in the game using Gemini:
- 🧍‍♀️ The main character is based on the gamer’s likeness, generated using **Gemini Nano Banana**, now reimagined as a skateboard-riding hero.
- 🎞️ Character riding and jumping animations were created using **Gemini Veo**, and background elements were removed for clean, transparent sprites.
- 🌆 Game assets such as the background and obstacles were also generated using the same AI tools.

This project blends creativity and code, using AI-assisted visual generation and good old-fashioned JavaScript to bring everything to life — no external libraries or engines involved.
